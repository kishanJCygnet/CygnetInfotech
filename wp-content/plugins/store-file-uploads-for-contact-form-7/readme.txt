When this is active, attachments sent trough Contact Form 7 shortcode [file ] will be stored in your Media Library

== Description ==

By default, [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) dose not keep data it sends trough it's contact forms.
While plugins like [Flamingo](https://wordpress.org/plugins/flamingo/) save that data,  uploaded files are not added to Media Library.
This plugin will save uploaded files to Media Library before email is sent by CF7.
This plugin will raise an event with the the full file path & name. 
Subscribe to `nmr_create_attachment_file_name` filter to get and/or update data before attachment is added to media library.

`
// The filter callback function.
function example_callback( $file_name ) {
    // (maybe) modify $file_name.
    return $file_name;
}
add_filter( 'nmr_create_attachment_file_name', 'example_callback', 10, 1 );
`

Subscribe to `nmr_before_insert_attachment` filter to be able to change attachment attributes:  caption and description are ‘post_excerpt’ and ‘post_content’.
For other attributes, check documentation for [wp_insert_attachment](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_insert_attachment/).

`
// The filter callback function.
function before_insert_attachment_callback( $attachment ) {
    // (maybe) modify $attachment array.
    return $attachment;
}
add_filter( 'before_insert_attachment_callback', 'example_callback', 10, 1 );
`

This plugin will send the final attachment id if you are interested in getting other details, like attachment url.
Listen to `nmr_create_attachment_id_generated` action.

`
// The action callback function.
function example_callback_id_generated( $attachment_id ) {
    // (maybe) do something with the args.
    $url = wp_get_attachment_url( $attachment_id );
}
add_action( 'nmr_create_attachment_id_generated', 'example_callback_id_generated', 10, 1 );
`
